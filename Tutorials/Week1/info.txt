Python

This will allow you to see if it is installed




print()
========

To print to the terminal in a python program:

	1. Open your text editor and save it in a file called: hello.py

	2. Write the following code in your program:

				print("Hello Python!")
				
	3.Run the program by entering into the terminal: python3 hello.py

	4.Your program should output the results



Comments
=========

In python, we use # to represent a line with a comment.

A line with '#' in the front will not be compiled and will be omitted by the
interpreter.

e.g.
	
		#This is a comment
		print("Hello World")
